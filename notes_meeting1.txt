NOTES MEETING 11/6

Get length of word from user (n)

Iterate through dictionary (25,602 words), insert only n-size words into data structure

Data structure: <map> from STL which is basically a hash table?
	- Find: best is O(1), avg is O(1), worst is O(n)


For each character guess
	For each word in data structure
		If word contains character c (use string.find() here?)
			remove word, rehash?


*May try copying code in book that uses <map> and test speed

-----------------------------

Also talked about STL vector, not sure if necessary.
Talked about minHeap.
